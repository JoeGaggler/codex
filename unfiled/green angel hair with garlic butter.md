the saturated green makes for a great book cover, but it is not a headliner dish.

it needed another green besides spinach to make it less... waxy. i think the effort to make it a "weekday butter confit" deprived it of some green "weekday" ingredients like cilantro, parsley, basil, peas. 

maybe i was just hoping for chimichurri.
